Lyft, you could draw the following conclusions:
1. Uber is more economical; however, Lyft also provides fair competition.
2. People prefer to have shared rides during the nighttime.
3. People avoid taking rides when it rains.
4. When traveling long distances, the price does not increase linearly. However, 
based on the time and demand, a surge can affect the cost.
